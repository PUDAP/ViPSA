# Kanban Worker — Pitfalls and Examples

> You're seeing this skill because the Hermes Kanban dispatcher spawned you as a worker with `--skills kanban-worker` — it's loaded automatically for every dispatched worker. The **lifecycle** (6 steps: orient → work → heartbeat → block/complete) also lives in the `KANBAN_GUIDANCE` block that's auto-injected into your system prompt. This skill is the deeper detail: good handoff shapes, retry diagnostics, edge cases.

## Workspace handling

Your workspace kind determines how you should behave inside `$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE`:

| Kind | What it is | How to work |
|---|---|---|
| `scratch` | Fresh tmp dir, yours alone | Read/write freely; it gets GC'd when the task is archived. |
| `dir:<path>` | Shared persistent directory | Other runs will read what you write. Treat it like long-lived state. Path is guaranteed absolute (the kernel rejects relative paths). |
| `worktree` | Git worktree at the resolved path | If `.git` doesn't exist, run `git worktree add <path> ${HERMES_KANBAN_BRANCH:-wt/$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK}` from the main repo first, then cd and work normally. Commit work here. |

## Tenant isolation

If `$HERMES_TENANT` is set, the task belongs to a tenant namespace. When reading or writing persistent memory, prefix memory entries with the tenant so context doesn't leak across tenants:

- Good: `business-a: Acme is our biggest customer`
- Bad (leaks): `Acme is our biggest customer`

## Good summary + metadata shapes

The `kanban_complete(summary=..., metadata=...)` handoff is how downstream workers read what you did. Patterns that work:

**Coding task:**
```python
kanban_complete(
    summary="shipped rate limiter — token bucket, keys on user_id with IP fallback, 14 tests pass",
    metadata={
        "changed_files": ["rate_limiter.py", "tests/test_rate_limiter.py"],
        "tests_run": 14,
        "tests_passed": 14,
        "decisions": ["user_id primary, IP fallback for unauthenticated requests"],
    },
)
```

**Coding task that needs human review (review-required):**

For most code-changing tasks, the work isn't truly *done* until a human reviewer has eyes on it. Block instead of complete, with `reason` prefixed `review-required: ` so the dashboard surfaces the row as needing review. Drop the structured metadata (changed files, test counts, diff/PR url) into a comment first, since `kanban_block` only carries the human-readable reason — comments are the durable annotation channel. Reviewer either approves and runs `hermes kanban unblock <id>` (which re-spawns you with the comment thread for any follow-ups) or asks for changes via another comment.

```python
import json

kanban_comment(
    body="review-required handoff:\n" + json.dumps({
        "changed_files": ["rate_limiter.py", "tests/test_rate_limiter.py"],
        "tests_run": 14,
        "tests_passed": 14,
        "diff_path": "/path/to/worktree",  # or PR url if pushed
        "decisions": ["user_id primary, IP fallback for unauthenticated requests"],
    }, indent=2),
)
kanban_block(
    reason="review-required: rate limiter shipped, 14/14 tests pass — needs eyes on the user_id/IP fallback choice before merging",
)
```

Use `kanban_complete` only when the task is genuinely terminal — e.g. a one-line typo fix, a docs change with no functional consequences, or a research task where the artifact IS the writeup itself.

**Research task:**
```python
kanban_complete(
    summary="3 competing libraries reviewed; vLLM wins on throughput, SGLang on latency, Tensorrt-LLM on memory efficiency",
    metadata={
        "sources_read": 12,
        "recommendation": "vLLM",
        "benchmarks": {"vllm": 1.0, "sglang": 0.87, "trtllm": 0.72},
```
