# macOS Computer Use (universal, any-model)

You have a `computer_use` tool that drives the Mac in the **background**.
Your actions do NOT move the user's cursor, steal keyboard focus, or switch
Spaces. The user can keep typing in their editor while you click around in
Safari in another Space. This is the opposite of pyautogui-style automation.

Everything here works with any tool-capable model — Claude, GPT, Gemini, or
an open model running through a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint. There is
no Anthropic-native schema to learn.

## The canonical workflow

**Step 1 — Capture first.** Almost every task starts with:

```
computer_use(action="capture", mode="som", app="Safari")
```

Returns a screenshot with numbered overlays on every interactable element
AND an AX-tree index like:

```
#1  AXButton 'Back' @ (12, 80, 28, 28) [Safari]
#2  AXTextField 'Address and Search' @ (80, 80, 900, 32) [Safari]
#7  AXLink 'Sign In' @ (900, 420, 80, 24) [Safari]
...
```

**Step 2 — Click by element index.** This is the single most important
habit:

```
computer_use(action="click", element=7)
```

Much more reliable than pixel coordinates for every model. Claude was
trained on both; other models are often only reliable with indices.

**Step 3 — Verify.** After any state-changing action, re-capture. You can
save a round-trip by asking for the post-action capture inline:

```
computer_use(action="click", element=7, capture_after=True)
```

## Capture modes

| `mode` | Returns | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `som` (default) | Screenshot + numbered overlays + AX index | Vision models; preferred default |
| `vision` | Plain screenshot | When SOM overlay interferes with what you want to verify |
| `ax` | AX tree only, no image | Text-only models, or when you don't need to see pixels |

## Actions

```
capture           mode=som|vision|ax   app=…  (default: current app)
click             element=N     OR     coordinate=[x, y]
double_click      element=N     OR     coordinate=[x, y]
right_click       element=N     OR     coordinate=[x, y]
middle_click      element=N     OR     coordinate=[x, y]
drag              from_element=N, to_element=M        (or from/to_coordinate)
scroll            direction=up|down|left|right   amount=3 (ticks)
```
